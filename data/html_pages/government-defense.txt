Video Walls for Mission-Critical Applications
Monitor and improve response times for mission-critical operations in command and control centers
Government, federal, military and defense agencies rely on video walls for secure, reliable and legible data management designed for the most demanding environments. Network operations centers are responsible for managing important data, including traffic flows, telecom networks, critical public utilities, public transportation systems and third party agencies. Network operators for government and defense organizations need to be equipped to deal with fast-moving situations and real-time.
Situational Awareness
Accurate and up-to-date data visualization is a critical component of the effectiveness in a crisis response. In a fast-moving situation, it’s often necessary to gather data from multiple sources and have the data collected in one centralized location. TRx’s drag and drop operation facilitates an intuitive management of ad-hoc visual information across video walls in control rooms and crisis rooms.
