VuWall Plugin for Q-SYS
TECH INTEGRATION IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN CONTROL ROOMS
The VuWall and Q-SYS seamlessly integrated solution empowers operators to consolidate systems to achieve greater efficiency in their operations. The plugin is designed to streamline control room operations by enabling direct control of VuWall’s ecosystem from the Q-SYS interface without any programming.
TRx is used to configure, manage and distribute virtually any source type to any display with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. As a contributor to the Q-SYS Ecosystem, VuWall collaborated with Q-SYS to create a market-ready control solution that integrates seamlessly into Q-SYS, a cloud-manageable audio, video, and control platform.
Key features of the VuWall TRx plugin include:
Seamless Control:
Manage VuWall’s TRx system directly within the Q-SYS environment — no programming required.
Enhanced Visibility:
Access real-time system status and feedback from the Q-SYS interface.
Advanced Functionality: Easily
