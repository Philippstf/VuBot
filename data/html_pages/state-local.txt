Unified visualization and control for police, emergency and other first responders
Appropriate and clear decision making is guided by solid, real-time data. In team-based command and control center environments, such as police, emergency and other first responder agencies, video walls serve as critical data hubs. State and local municipalities employ 24/7 teams to provide immediate response to emergency events. Content management systems for video wall displays provide operators with consistent visual information to monitor, assess and respond accordingly.
Optimized Management
Operators can view and manage critical information in a central location. With the TRx software, operators can manage and distribute any AV content across multiple displays and video walls with easy drag-and-drop functionality. Operators have the freedom to change layouts and control devices with a simple touch.
Flexibility
The interoperability offered by TRx allows to seamlessly process any AV or IP feeds from cameras, web apps, encoders, media players and other devices. Operators can access various third-party application components to streamline and simplify workflows for the utmost flexibility.
24/7 Reliability
Deployed within mission-critical environments worldwide, our systems are designed for time-sensitive operations. We ensure full availability and control of your visualization infrastructure with redundancy and High Availability (HA) options.
User-Friendly Control
Operators can control and manipulate mission-critical content on any video wall with easy drag-and-drop. The content can be moved, resized, cropped or zoomed, and shared to other video walls.
Future-Proof Design
Our solutions are modular, scalable, and interoperable with third party solutions. Thanks to the interoperability inherent of the TRx platform, integration with existing infrastructure is made easy. It’s also a system that future-proofs your infrastructure as it allows you to easily expand and allows you to meet growing needs.
