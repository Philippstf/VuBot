Manage multiple content sources seamlessly to streamline road, rail, sea or air transportation
Video wall displays and content management are essential in providing operators with the visual information they need to monitor, assess and respond in traffic and transportation applications. Whether monitoring road, rail, sea or air transportation, the traffic management center is responsible for evaluating time-sensitive surveillance, map data and sensor information. Today, video displays and content management solutions have become the backbone for operators managing some of the world’s busiest urban traffic networks.
Situation Awareness
In order to make informed decisions, Traffic Management Operators need to gather critical information from different visual systems like maps, cameras, dashboards and display it on any video wall or crisis room displays in their facility. With the TRx software, operators can easily manage these sources and even select a region of interest on their desktop or on the video wall and share it with the various rooms or any other stakeholder in the organization.
Flexibility
Operators can visualize content from any type of device to an unlimited number of displays. Our TRx solution ensures interoperability between multiple formats of content coming from IP cameras, web apps, computers, encoders, media players and other devices. A tool to create custom control panels as well as the scripting tool facilitates the creation of automated triggers, emergency messaging and many other integrated features.
