Enable security teams to interact with real-time data in the right place at the right time
Reliable video wall displays and content management are essential in providing security operations center teams with the visual information they need to monitor, assess and respond accordingly. Whether it’s homeland security, airport security, computer and data security, or other essential applications, video wall technology enables stakeholders to make informed decisions from gathering important information on a single display surface, coming from multiple sources such as cameras, maps, operators computers or dashboards. TRx’s unique centralized platform facilitates seamless collaboration between operators, supervisors and decision makers.
Situation Awareness
Operators can easily gather critical information on their desktop and seamlessly display the content on any video wall or video display in a crisis room, war room or mission critical environment throughout their facility. Operators can easily select a region of interest on their desktop or on the video wall and share it with the various rooms or any other stakeholder in the organization.
Flexibility
Operators can visualize content from any type of device and an unlimited number of devices. Our TRx software can seamlessly route any AV or IP feed from cameras, web apps, encoders, media players and other devices. With customizable control panels, automated triggers, emergency messaging and many other integrated features, our solutions allow operators to remain focused on their mission.
24/7 Reliability
Deployed within mission-critical environments worldwide, our systems are designed for time-sensitive operations for 24/7 reliability featuring complete redundancy. Requiring less hardware than traditional configurations, our solution requires fewer connections yielding to less risk of technical failure.
User-Friendly Control
Our easy-to-use interface allows operators to quickly and easily control and manage content during the time-critical situations. Operators can easily arrange content on the video walls in real-time or integrate pre-arranged layouts. A simple touch interface empowers immediate control of the system.
