Unified Control for Network Operations in Utilities
Process and transmit critical data for reliable monitoring to ensure safety and efficiency
As the flow of resources becomes more complex, utility operation centers need to streamline their flow of information. Control room operators are gathering multiple sources to oversee resources, power and utility generation, transmission and distribution. The master control room can be a demanding environment. TRx, our unique centralized platform, empowers operators to interact with multiple sources in various formats and react in real-time without letting technology get in their way
Situational Awareness
Utilities must manage their data and resources carefully to reduce the risk of costly disruptions to day-to-day operations. This requires gathering data from multiple sources to ensure accurate, usable information and anticipate potential crisis situations.
24/7 Reliability
Operators require clear information in order to make real-time informed decisions on critical issues. Trx is a reliable solution for content management for video wall displays that empower operators with consistent visual information to monitor, assess and respond accordingly.
Flexibility
VuWall’s ecosystem of products can be integrated with existing infrastructure to enable operators to capture and analyze real-time data from multiple inputs in multiple formats and make time-critical decisions with confidence.
User-Friendly Control
TRx enables easy drag and drop operations for users to configure and operate all devices. Our technology eliminates traditional programming to reduce configuration and deployment time in the field.
Security

Future-Proof
Our solutions are modular, scalable, and interoperable with third party solutions. Customers never have to worry about interoperability with an existing infrastructure nor do they have to worry about adding new equipment as needs evolve.
