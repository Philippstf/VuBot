Why PAK KVM?
Interactive Collaboration
PAK KVM offers low latency for a smooth and seamless experience, allowing operators to control IP sources with their keyboard & mouse and share content with other operators – all with an intuitive easy-to-use platform, enhancing the operator experience and increasing productivity.
Multiview with KVM
Sources from remote PCs can be controlled with keyboard and mouse via IP KVM encoders such as VuStream 350. Those source can then be displayed alongside IP streams from encoders, cameras, or TV channels.
Simplified Deployments
Stitching PAK nodes together is an effortless way of creating KVM operator stations and IP video walls of any size. The Configuration Tool of PAK is user-friendly and helps in configuring the system by selecting tiling arrangements, setting bezel compensation, and configuring outputs and resolutions. This makes setting up your system much easier.
Secure Access
By utilizing password-protected KVM environments, installations can be safeguarded by restricting access and control of KVM systems to authorized users only. This security measure is crucial in preventing unauthorized access that could result in security breaches and other related incidents. Implementing password-protected KVM enables organizations to have better control over their IT system and achieve a higher level of security.
