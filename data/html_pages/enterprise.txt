Bring your teams together to share ideas and make decisions with real-time data. Easily share presentations, use annotation tools, visualize external content from control rooms or other meeting rooms, or analyze dashboards. Turn your meeting rooms into versatile collaboration rooms with the full-featured TRx platform, for easily managing & distributing content throughout your entire organizations.
Fully Integrated
Reduce your footprint with a VuScape system that combines the functions of a graphics station, matrix switch and control system in a single box. Run some of your favorite collaboration and annotation tools such as Hoylu and Deon, directly from VuScape.
Nothing to Install
