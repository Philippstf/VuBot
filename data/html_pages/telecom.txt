Manage multiple sources seamlessly to support data centers, telecom and IT infrastructure
Telecommunications, data centers and IT operation centers are continuously growing with their expansion in network and service. Network operators are gathering multiple sources to support infrastructure, including gateways, satellite access and network connections. Reliable content management systems for video wall displays empower operators with consistent visual information to monitor, assess and respond accordingly. With the TRx centralized management platform, operators can observe important details from multiple sources and react in real-time.
Optimized Management
Operators can view and manage critical information in a central location. With the TRx software, operators can manage and distribute any AV content across multiple displays and video walls with easy drag-and-drop functionality. Operators have the freedom to change layouts and control devices with a simple touch.
Flexibility
Our TRx system can seamlessly route any AV or IP feed from cameras, web apps, encoders, media players and other devices. Operators can access various third-party application components to streamline and simplify workflows for the utmost flexibility.
24/7 Reliability
Deployed within mission-critical environments worldwide, our systems are designed for time-sensitive operations. We ensure full availability and control of your visualization infrastructure with redundancy and High Availability (HA) options.
User-Friendly Control
Operators can control and manipulate mission-critical content on any video wall with easy drag-and-drop. The content can be moved, resized, cropped or zoomed, and shared to other video walls.
Future-Proof Design
Our solutions are modular, scalable, and interoperable with third party solutions. Thanks to the underlying VuTrex technology, the TRx software eliminates common challenges of interoperability with existing infrastructure. It’s also a future-proof system that is designed to easily expand to meet growing needs.
